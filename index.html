                        As Principal Developer and Architect I have been responsible for 8 development teams within the Fulfilment and Logistics domain working on retail and 3rd party integration, warehouse operations, last mile delivery and everything in-between. I designed
                        and guided teams in implementing a new modern API based Fulfilment Platform leveraging AWS cloud technologies.

                    <p>
                        Another major part of my role was to be instrumental in helping teams to work together, aligning and enabling them to work on large scale projects which cross different domain context's and additionally helping to bridge communications to other principal
                        domains to share knowledge, skills and methodologies. During this we performed full audits of the diverse technology stack, infrastructure and team topologies to gain a full understanding of the estate as this was a complete unknown
                        before I started. Using this information we made recommendations in areas where we could consolidate and align to work more efficiently and become more agile.

                        tracking. I have also been responsible for the back office management tools used day to day by the customer service agents to serve customer request and the native iOS and Android applications.

                        Responsible for designing many of the apps, services and API's driving the omni-channel customer experience. I revamped the development process establishing common standards and practises ensuring that developers across all teams work to the same processes
                        and routines. This included a complete DevOps overhaul and the set up and configuration of new SCM and CI servers with automated continuous deployment pipelines using GitLab and Jenkins. I built and managed on premise Docker clusters
                        and worked with the infrastructure teams to impart Linux server management skills for deployment of .NET Core services on Linux hosts as well as creating Azure environments for cloud hosted services.

                        Working alongside my business partner in the design and development of business-critical systems for the real estate sector building a first-class web based CRM and business management solution which allows estate agents within Europe to network and manage
                        their websites, portfolios and contacts. As part of this I was responsible for writing and maintaining several large scale MVC applications as well as working with the full stack of software and hardware associated with running
                        and hosting a business. This included building and configuring a secure network of servers to host and run the various apps and services as well as deployments and maintenance.

                        and implementation of a new members' portal for their customers to manage their accounts and financial information. I have also been responsible for managing the clients in house servers and performing scheduled maintenance. The
                        solutions required use of C#, SQL 2005 and integration with Mando Groups' bespoke in house CMS.

                        While at dabs.com I spearheaded a number of large projects which resulted in the production of key systems that the company uses in every day to day process. I was responsible for architecting a new ground up rewrite of the dabs.com website which required
                        the design and implementation of a multi locale e-commerce platform capable of running any number of white label websites from a single code base. The system needed to be secure, have high performance to handle hundreds of concurrent
                        connections and be configurable with minimal development input. As part of the project I also created an additional suite of Windows Forms desktop tools to work hand in hand with the website and allow users to manage key stock
                        information. This led to several large business critical applications which are now used every day for managing product details and controlling the configuration of the website, allowing users to customise text, images, and features
                        from a single management application.
