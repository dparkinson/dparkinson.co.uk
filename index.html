    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      I am an experienced technical/solutions architect and developer with a proven track 
      record of delivering business transformation projects and innovative software solutions 
      across omni-channel retail, estate agency, business management and gaming industries 
      in both upgrading and migrating existing systems and creating whole new Software as a 
      Service (SaaS) solutions from the ground up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with large teams of varied disciplines I have been responsible for ensuring that 
      designs and implementations are agreed, and standards and quality targets are being met. 
      Liaising directly with senior C-Level executives I have taken ownership of planning, 
      design and execution of the software and services needed to drive many aspects of modern 
      business forward from warehouse management and customer delivery to online and retail 
      store sales and purchase ordering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have an innate desire to learn, and I am always updating my technical capabilities to 
      ensure that I have a good grasp of the latest technologies coming to market. I have an 
      in depth understanding of .NET, Ruby, RDBMS', Agile Methodologies, Domain Driven Design, 
      Micro-Architectures, Azure, AWS, DevOps, Networking and Server management. I have been 
      able to use my wide range of skills on numerous occasions to bridge the gaps between 
      different teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy being able to leverage my skills in a role where I can be responsible for 
      steering and making leadership decisions using my knowledge of technology to inform and 
      guide business strategies and take a hands-on role in implementing solutions.
